# PCRealm

PCRealm is a web-based system designed to help users build their ideal PC setup while staying within their budget. It allows users to select compatible components based on their needs—such as gaming, work, or school—making the PC building process easier and more guided, especially for beginners. The platform focuses on simplifying decision-making by organizing components clearly and providing an intuitive user flow for selecting, comparing, and finalizing PC builds.

To ensure a user-friendly and well-structured experience, the application’s interface and user flow were designed using Figma. The design prototype presents the overall layout, navigation, and interaction flow of the system. Below is the link to view the Figma design and application flow:
